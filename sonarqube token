steps to generate a SonarQube token and add it to your Bitbucket pipeline environment variables:

Log in to your SonarQube instance and go to the Administration tab.

Click on the Security tab and then click on Users.

Click on the Create User button and fill in the required details to create a new user. Make sure to give the user the "Execute Analysis" permission.

Once the user is created, click on the user's name to go to the user profile page.

Click on the Security tab and then click on Generate Tokens.

Enter a name for the token, such as "Bitbucket Pipelines", and click Generate.

Copy the token value that is generated. Make sure to save this token somewhere safe, as you won't be able to see it again.

Go to your Bitbucket repository and click on the Settings icon and select "Pipelines".

Scroll down to the Environment variables section and click on "Add variables".

Enter SONAR_TOKEN as the name of the variable, and paste the SonarQube token value into the Value field.

Click "Add" to save the environment variable.

With the above steps, We will have created a SonarQube token and added it to your Bitbucket pipeline environment variables, allowing your pipeline to access your SonarQube instance for code analysis.
