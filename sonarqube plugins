To configure SonarQube with the correct plugins and settings for .NET analysis, you'll need to follow these steps:

Install the SonarScanner for MSBuild on your build agent or build server. You can download the latest version of the scanner from the SonarScanner for MSBuild page on the official SonarQube website.

Install the C# plugin for SonarQube. You can install the plugin from the Marketplace tab in your SonarQube instance.

Set up your SonarQube project for .NET analysis by creating a new project in SonarQube and selecting the "C#" language option.

Configure the analysis parameters for your project by adding a sonar-project.properties file to the root of your project.

Here's an example sonar-project.properties file:

php

sonar.projectKey=<your-project-key>
sonar.projectName=<your-project-name>
sonar.host.url=<your-sonarqube-url>
sonar.sources=.
sonar.language=cs
sonar.sourceEncoding=UTF-8
Make sure to replace <your-project-key>, <your-project-name>, and <your-sonarqube-url> with the appropriate values for our project.

Run the SonarScanner for MSBuild from the command line using the begin, build, and end steps. Here's an example command:
bash

dotnet sonarscanner begin /k:"<your-project-key>" /d:sonar.host.url="<your-sonarqube-url>" /d:sonar.login="${SONAR_TOKEN}"
dotnet build
dotnet sonarscanner end /d:sonar.login="${SONAR_TOKEN}"
Make sure to replace <your-project-key> and <your-sonarqube-url> with the appropriate values for our project.

Review the analysis results in SonarQube. We should see code quality metrics, test coverage reports, and other analysis information for your .NET project.
By following these steps, we can configure SonarQube for .NET analysis and use it with your Bitbucket pipeline to ensure code quality and prevent merges if code quality or test coverage criteria are not met.
